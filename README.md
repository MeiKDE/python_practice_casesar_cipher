Caesar Cipher Program
This project implements a simple Caesar cipher program in Python. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. 

Features
Encoding: Converts a message into an encrypted form by shifting letters based on a user-specified shift number.
Decoding: Decrypts an encoded message using the same shift number.
Continuous Operation: The program allows users to continuously encode or decode messages until they choose to exit.
